Fix N in run_arrays
Get checks working
Improve numerical performance of hydraulic iteration loops
Add iteration for multipass heat exchangers


pressure drop due to expansions (Ke Kc) etc need to be doubled for multipass

LESTER REMINDER TOMORROW, UPDATE OTHER [PAIR ON;]

width of header tnk without valve (i.e. two shell pass) needs to be assigned as a variable soemwhere probably in fucntions but not sure, can change what weve done
weve defined it as a variable inside a fucntion but we shoudlnt do this

    POINT 2
    we assumed 2 shell 2 pass uses CF, but should it not need iot if it is simply a really long counterflow HX?
